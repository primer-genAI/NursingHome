They have a Foley catheter (size 18Fr) for urine drainage, which is working well. The patient can control their urine but not their stool, so they wear a diaper. We checked the hospital's air mattress to make sure it hasn't deflated and helped the patient change positions, giving them a back massage. We also educated the patient about the risk of falls and provided emotional support.
