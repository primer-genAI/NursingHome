* At 07:50, the patient was in a bedridden state with left hemiparesis (weakness on the left side). The nurse noted that the L-tube (18Fr) was kept in place, and a 400-400-400kcal/day enteral feeding solution was given. The patient was wearing diapers due to incontinence (some stool was sticking to the diaper each time). The patient repeatedly hit the bed rail with their right hand and showed repetitive behavior. The nurse checked the air mattress for any deflation, changed the patient's position, and performed a back massage.
